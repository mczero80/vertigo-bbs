	What is ACS?
	============

	ACS is a pseudonym for Access Command System. The ACS system is used
	throughout Mystic BBS to define access requirements to certain commands and
	functions.

	The ACS system is extremely powerful and designed to give the System Operator
	total control over who can do what.

	ACS values can be found in various locations throughout the configuration
	editors, and can also be used inside MPL programs and BBS menus.

	=================
	ACS String Syntax
	=================

	An ACS string consists of an operator command, followed by secondary data if
	that operator command requires secondary data. Many operator commands do
	require additional information (secondary data), but there are some that do
	not.

	Each operator command is calculated to either a TRUE or FALSE value depending
	on the type of operator and the data it is targeting.

	Operator commands can also be used in conjunction with logical operators in
	order to create complex ACS strings. If the overall result of an ACS string
	is TRUE, then the user is given access to whatever the ACS string is
	protecting.  If the overall result of the ACS string is FALSE, then the user
	does not gain access to whatever the ACS string is protecting.

	The following logical operators are supported:

	   & = Logical AND
	   | = Logical OR
	   ! = Logical NOT
	   ^ = Always TRUE
	   % = Always FALSE

	In addition to the logical operators, parentheses can be used to give priority
	to a specific calculation so that its TRUE/FALSE result is calculated before
	others.  Generally, operators are evaluated in the order that they appear,
	unless parenthesis are supplied to state otherwise.

	ACS strings can contain a maximum of 30 characters/

	ACS Operator Command Reference
	==============================

        Ax  -  This command is used to check the user's age.  Where X is
               the age the user must be in order to pass.

   Dx  -  This command is used to check if a user has a certain flag
          toggled ON in their SECOND set of flags.  Where X is the
          flag which the user must have in order to pass.  For
          example: DA will require the user to have user access flag
          D in flag set 2 in order to pass.

   Ex  -  This command is used to check the user's current graphics
          mode.  Where X is one of the following:
   
               1 - User must have ANSI graphics
               0 - User must have ASCII (none) graphics.

   Fx  -  This command is used to check if a user has a certain flag
          toggled ON in their FIRST set of flags.  Where X is the
          flag which the user must have in order to pass.  For
          example: FA will require the user to have user access flag
          A in flag set 1 in order to pass.

   Gx  -  This command is used to check if a user is in a certain
          message group.  Where X is the number of the group as listed
          in the message group editor.  For example: G1 will require
          the user to be in message group #1 in order to pass.

   Hx  -  This command is used to check if a user is accessing
          a command at a certain hour.  Where X is the hour in the
          24-hour mode (ie 00 is midnight or after, 23 is 11pm or
          after).  For example: H12 will prevent the user from
          accessing this command before 12 noon on any given day.

   Mx  -  This command is used to check if a user is accessing
          a command at a certain minute.  Where X is the minute in
          the hour.  For example: M30 will prevent the user from
          accessing this command in the first 30 minutes of the
          hour.

   Nx  -  This command is used to check if a user is online a
          certain node number.  For example: N1 will require that
          the user is currently logged in on Node 1 in order to
          pass.

   OA  -  This command is used to check the status of the user's
          node message availibility.  If the user is able to
          receive node messages, OA will return true.  False if
          they are not available.

   OI  -  This command is used to check if a user's node status
          is invisible to other nodes.  It will be set TRUE if
          the user is invisible, false if not.

   OK  -  This command is used to check the result of the last
          called Boolean menu command.  For more information, see
          the menu commands: -P, -Y, and -N.

   OM  -  This command returns TRUE if the user has SysOp access
          to the current message base  *OR*  if the user is
          currently reading a message and the message they are
          reading was posted by them.

   ON  -  This command returns TRUE if the last message scan had
          new messages.

   OP  -  This command is used to check the status of the user's
          post / call ratio.  If the user meets the currently set
          ratio, then OP will be true - otherwise, if will return
          false.  This option is useful to restrict users from
          downloading if they're not active message posters.

   OY  -  This command returns TRUE if the last message scan had
          new messages addressed to the user. 

   Sx  -  This command is used to check if a user meets a certain
          security level.  For example: S20 will require the user
          to have a security level of 20 or higher in order to
          pass.

   Tx  -  This command is used to check if a user has at least
          X minutes remaining in online time.  For example: T10
          would require the user to have a least 10 minutes of
          remaining time in order to pass.

   Ux  -  This command is used to check a user's permanent user
          number, where X is the number of the permanent index the
          user must match.  For example: U1 would require the user
          to have the permanent user index of 1.  Each user's
          permanent index is listed in the user editor, and no two
          users will ever have the same permanent index number.

   Wx  -  This command is used to evaluate the current day of the
          week, where X is a number from 0 to 6, each one begin
          equivalent to a day in the week:
          
               0 - Sunday
               1 - Monday
               2 - Tuesday
