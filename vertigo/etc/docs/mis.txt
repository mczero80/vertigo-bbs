
Mystic Internet Server
======================

MIS is an application which acts as a server for various internet
protocols.  At this time and can server one or all of the following:

Telnet, POP3, SMTP, FTP, and NNTP.

MIS needs to exist in the same folder as MYSTIC.EXE and MYSTIC.DAT files
in order to work.  It optionally will check for the "mysticbbs" environment
variable if it exists to find the directory where MYSTIC.DAT resides.

The options for MIS can be found on the Servers menu within the system
configuration (ie, running mystic -cfg or from the sysop menu when
logged in).  You can enable/disable different server types, change their
listening ports, and some other options.

Keep in mind that Linux will require a root user by default to bind to
server ports less than 1024, so if you enable your telnet server and
cannot connect, try a port higher than 1024 to make sure it is working.

Setting up a telnet BBS is as simple as loading MIS and telnetting in! :)

It is also worth pointing out that the FTP server does not allow
uploads, only downloads for now.  This is because I haven't decided how I
want it to handle processing uploaded files yet.

MIS COMMANDS
============
	Arrow keys : Move around the node/status listing.  Left and right
                     work as page up/down.
	SPACE      : Attempts to telnet to your own BBS so you can
                     login from the MIS console.  You must have an
                     open node for this to work.  It tries to connect
                     to 127.0.0.1 at whatever the configured telnet port
                     is.  This means it should work for local login via
                     Linux and OSX that still use inetd-type services for
                     telnet sessions (for now).
        ESCAPE     : Shut down MIS (disconnects all nodes)

IP BLOCKING
===========

MIS will check your Mystic DATA directory for file named "badip.txt".
It will use this file to check against the IP addresses of incoming
connections.  For example, if you wanted to block 123.123.123.123
you would simply add a line into the badip.txt file with that IP
address.

IP blocking supports wildcards too, so for example, you could put
123.123.123.* and block any IP address that begins with
123.123.123.

If an IP address is blocked, Mystic will attempt to send them the
contents of the file "blocked.txt" from the Mystic DATA directory.
If this file does not exist, it will simply print "BLOCKED" to the
connection's terminal and disconnect them.

DUPLICATE IP CONNECTIONS
========================

MIS will block an IP from opening multiple connections to the BBS.  If a
person is already connected to Mystic and they attempt to open a second
connection, MIS will attempt to send them the contents of the file
"dupeip.txt" from the Mystic DATA directory.

If the file does not exist, it will simply send them "Only 1
connection(s) per user" and disconnect only their second connection.
Their first connection will remain untouched.

BUSY NOTIFICATIONS
==================

If a connection is made when all of the nodes configured for telnet are
being used, MIS will attempt to send them the contents of busy.txt from
the Mystic DATA directory.  If this file does not exist, it will simply
print "BUSY" to the terminal and disconnect them.
